creating a graph
- i have allways created a graph using adjaceny list as arraylist of arraylist of integer
and this arraylist of arraylist was first filled with initial empty arraylists one empty array list per node.
check to see if something better can be done here, is the way i am doing this the most efficient way of doing it?
- for adjancency list we could also use a map map<node,list of adjacent vertices>
this way if the graph is sparse we would save up on good amount of space.
- in prims solution i have constructed a graph using map
