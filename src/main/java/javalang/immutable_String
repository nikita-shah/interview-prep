why is a string mutable?
    ->https://www.baeldung.com/java-string-immutable
    --> string pool, using same physical string for different references, saves memory.
    --> security, strings could be storing sensitive info like user name etc, these should not accidently be modified during the course of execution
    --> we get advantage of thread safety because they are ikmmutable, as when we try to change, a new string object is created and returned, original ooone remains inrtact
