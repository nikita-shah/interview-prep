Trees
- post order traversal iterative without reversing
- with reversing logic -> https://www.scaler.com/academy/mentee-dashboard/class/13289/homework/problems/229/submissionsßß

LinkedList
- class in java is used for queues, deque, linked list, doubly linked list?
- in linked list class there is no such thing as next
- just check this out later.


Segment Trees
- left from Ayush Sharma's class.


Java
- check out ordered vs unordered map in java,
operation time complexixities and internal implementations


Heaps
- have always used priority queues
- do write code for actual implementation of heap.
(up heapify downheapify etc, and all other operartions of heap.)
- implement array heap
- whenever you are giving an online test, do keep the heap code handy with you.(or not since you ll always cofde in java)
- watch heaps 1 class of mohit sharma later (could do this before implementing the heap)
- heap questions  for both heaps 1 and heaps 2 for earlier batch assignment too are left


Tries
- problems are not done


Search, Sort (Mohit)
- ask for including mohit's searching and sorting from the september batch into my batch.


Contest 1,2,3 problems left.


Time complexity
- relative ordering n!, 2^n,
- also not very confident in caculating time factorial, practice more here.
